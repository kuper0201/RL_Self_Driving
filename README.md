> A Reinforcement Learning project for self-driving cars.

## About the Project

A project to train a reinforcement learning model for lane-following driving.
This serves as a foundation for high-level autonomous driving, and through various attempts, I expect to achieve a more advanced implementation of autonomous driving.

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- Stable Baselines3
- Gymnasium
- Pillow
- Carla(v0.9.15)
- Carla Additional Maps(optional)

## Features

- Train a new RL model for self-driving car.
